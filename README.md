# TraveLink
Our first project on the journey to becomeing web developers, **TraveLink** gives a traveler the ability to explore entertainment options in their destination city with a weather forecast so the savvy traveler can be prepared for whatever mother nature brings.  

The traveler can save to an itinerary, the events they're most interested in and follow a hyperlink to purchase admission.  

Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:

**As a** traveler to a brand new city,

**I want to** know what entertainment options are available and what the weather will be like,

**So that** I can make the most of my trip.


## Take it for a spin!
