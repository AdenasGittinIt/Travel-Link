# TraveLink
Our first project on the journey to becomeing web developers, **TraveLink** gives a traveler the ability to explore entertainment options in their destination city with a weather forecast so the savvy traveler can be prepared for whatever mother nature has planned.  

The traveler can save to an itinerary the events they're most interested in and follow a hyperlink to purchase admission.  

Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:

**As a** traveler to a brand new city,

**I want to** know what entertainment options are available and what the weather will be like,

**So that** I can make the most of my trip.


## Take it for a spin

To use the app, enter your arrival and departure dates, and the name of the US city you're traveling to then click 'Search'.  Once your search results display click the 'Add to Itinerary' button below the event's image to add the events you're interested in to your itinerary.
