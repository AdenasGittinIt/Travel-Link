# TraveLink
Our first project on our journey to becomeing web developers, **TraveLink** gives a traveler the ability to explore entertainment options in their destination city.  It also provides a weather forecast so the savvy traveler can be prepared for whatever mother nature throws their way.  The traveler can save to an itinerary the events they're most interested in and follow a hyperlink to purchase admission.  Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:

**As a** traveler to a brand new city,

**I want to** know what entertainment options are available and what the weather will be like,

**So that** I can make the most of my trip.


## Take it for a spin!

To use the app, enter the date of your arrival and departure and the name of any US city then click search.  Once your search results display click the "Add to Itenerary" button to add events of interest to your itinerary.
